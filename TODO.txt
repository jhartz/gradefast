TODO
====

- In grade book, for each line, make a drop down (or button of some sort) to show previous score/comments values, and click on one to copy it ("Copy Previous Value")
- Ability to add deductions to the list on-the-fly
- In monstrous list of options after a command, add "f" ("open folder")
  - Move some of the things to *before* the command (like to skip it or modify it), and then we don't need submission.modify_all_commands() since none run right away
- Make greasemonkey script for Desire2Learn platforms for automatically adding grades

    $(".dsh_c")[0].parentNode.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName("td")[1].textContent.trim()
