TODO
====

- Save files (spec'd in YAML config)
- In grade book, make a "note book" where we store commonly used notes, and we
  can access it by right-clicking in any of the comment boxes and it brings it
  up, and we can click on something to insert it at that point, or add a new
  one. It would show at the top the ones that were created on the comment box
  where we right-clicked, and then below it the ones created on other boxes.
- Add "shortcut" command to open a list of files in a given editor (or maybe
  just another option on a command to append this list to the end of the
  parameters). Then we can have an order for the files, and any extra other
  files in the dir can be appended to the end of the list.
- In grade book, make a "down arrow" button next to the Name at the top of the
  page to allow users to go back to previous submissions. The drop-down list
  should include the score next to each name, and for submissions other than
  the latest one, a link to the log HTML page (/gradefast/log/<id>)
- Store grades and shit as we go in a location spec'd in the YAML file (store
  it using pickle)
- Make separate shell script or something to parse the index.html from
  Desire2Learn platforms to add "pre-data" into the YAML file somehow (so we
  can take the comments they wrote when uploading, and also possibly whether
  it was late, and put it in the YAML beforehand)
    - Also in this script if we have multiple submissions by the same person,
      run a checksum on them to make sure they're different and, if not,
      delete the earlier one
    - Actually, in general, delete the earlier one for any submissions that
      have multiple submissions (unless one is on time and other is late)
- Make greasemonkey script for Desire2Learn platforms for automatically adding
  grades...
