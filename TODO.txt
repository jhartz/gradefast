Little TODOs:

- When we send which submission we're on to the gradebook, pass in the index too
  (so that when we go back or jump around it don't throw it off)
- For sections, add a "scale" option that takes a ratio to scale the section by
  (or a string representing a fraction)
- subprocess.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP (if it's a background process)
  Then catch Ctrl-C manually (in the "Waiting" stage) and do process.terminate()
  Also test the current functionality on linux... and this might be useful:

- Like entering grades on mycourses, mark background in gradebook when a grade
  item is modified
- For grade structures, add "collapsible" option to collapse the structure if
  it's either 0 or 100 (and with no comments/point hints/section deductions,
  and all grade items are exactly full points)
- Unicode issues (in comments, shows up weird in CSV file)
- 3 states for grade structures: enabled, disabled, or collapsed, in which case
  any sub grades are not shown, and we just enter one big point value, one big
  comment.
- Add "check point hint range" into YAML file
- Better signaling between gradebook and grader (can still be 1-way, since the
  gradebook shouldn't really have to communicate with the grader).
  Things we could do with this:
  - Make a section in the YAML commands to take the output of a command (or
    the last line of output) and use that as the grade for a certain grading
    item (identified by name... if there's more than 1, then they both get it)
- Make "pre-run" and "post-cleanup" sections in the YAML file with commands to
  run before starting any grading, and after all the grading is complete.
  (Store that the pre-run was run so that it'll store in the savefile)
- When asking whether a directory satisfies our innate human needs, and the
  user enters a new one, make it relative to the *current directory*,
  NOT the root of the submission.
- New YAML file command environmental variable: GRADEFAST_ROOT (the path to the
  GradeFast package / main script)
- Option to "steal back" terminal/cmd window focus after running a command
- For comments, instead of textareas, show the rendered Markdown, then, on
  click, switch it to a textarea (until it loses focus)
- For "folder"s in the command section of the YAML file, add "confirm" option
  that defaults to true, but if set to false, skips the "Does this folder
  satisfy your innate human needs?" prompt
- When running a command, ability to NOT do diff, or to enter a different diff
  filename. (same w/ input)
- Add ability to specify a max running time for a process (useful for
  background commands), and then some sort of action if it's cut off (like
  above idea of using program output as comment text)
- Better ability to select a folder (some sort of fancy CLI folder select
  dialog)
- When specifying a folder, add ability to specify "required files" that must
  be in the folder (and option with it to look thru sub-folders to see if any
  match the requirement)
- For point hints, if no value is specified, then it doesn't change the point
  total -- just shows a message to the user.

- TODO: TODOs IN THE FILES THEMSELVES!!!

Big TODOs:

- Save files (spec'd in YAML config)
- In grade book, make a "note book" where we store commonly used notes, and we
  can access it by right-clicking in any of the comment boxes and it brings it
  up, and we can click on something to insert it at that point, or add a new
  one. It would show at the top the ones that were created on the comment box
  where we right-clicked, and then below it the ones created on other boxes.
- Add "shortcut" command to open a list of files in a given editor (or maybe
  just another option on a command to append this list to the end of the
  parameters). Then we can have an order for the files, and any extra other
  files in the dir can be appended to the end of the list.
- In grade book, make a "down arrow" button next to the Name at the top of the
  page to allow users to go back to previous submissions. The drop-down list
  should include the score next to each name, and for submissions other than
  the latest one, a link to the log HTML page (/gradefast/log/<id>)
- Make separate shell script or something to parse the index.html from
  Desire2Learn platforms to add "pre-data" into the YAML file somehow (so we
  can take the comments they wrote when uploading, and also possibly whether
  it was late, and put it in the YAML beforehand)
    - Also in this script if we have multiple submissions by the same person,
      run a checksum on them to make sure they're different and, if not,
      delete the earlier one
    - Actually, in general, delete the earlier one for any submissions that
      have multiple submissions (unless one is on time and other is late)
