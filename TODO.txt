TODO
====

- In grade book, for each line, make a drop down (or button of some sort) to
  show previous score/comments values, and click on one to copy it ("Copy
  Previous Value")
- In grade book, make a "down arrow" button next to the Name at the top of the
  page to allow users to go back to previous submissions. The drop-down list
  should include the score next to each name.
- On index page, make the <h1> for the page title and the <h1> for the name
  different elements; section() will show the name <h1> if it's showing $main,
  but show the title <h1> otherwise.
- Store grades and shit as we go in a location spec'd in the YAML file (store
  it using pickle)
- Make logging system for output of Grader (by overriding FancyIO's print and
  input methods) that stores the output log along with the grade (in
  SubmissionGrade) and then in the dropdown from TODO#2, also have a button to
  view the output. (On SubmissionGrade, have a method "get_output_as_html" that
  replaces Colorama.Fore.RED with <span style="color: red;">, etc.)
- Make greasemonkey script for Desire2Learn platforms for automatically adding
  grades...
